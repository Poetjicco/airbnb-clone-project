# airbnb-clone-project
## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.
## Team Roles
Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
## Technology Stack
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
## Database Design
Users → Properties: A user (host) can list multiple properties.
Users → Bookings: A user (guest) can make multiple bookings.
Properties → Bookings: A property can have multiple bookings.
Users → Reviews: A user can leave multiple reviews.
Properties → Reviews: A property can have multiple reviews.
Bookings → Payments: Each booking has one payment record.
## Feature Breakdown
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
## API Security
Security is essential to protect user data, payments, and platform integrity.
Authentication: Encrypted passwords & token-based login → prevents unauthorized access.
Authorization: Role-based access control → users only perform allowed actions.
Encryption: HTTPS/TLS & secure storage → protects sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Rate Limiting: Limits requests & login attempts → blocks brute-force and abuse.
Payments: Trusted gateways (Stripe/PayPal) → safe, compliant transactions.
Input Validation: Sanitized input → prevents SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.
Monitoring: Activity logs & alerts → detects suspicious behavior early.
